# Spectral Segmentation

Problem: given image data $(K,H,W)$ with many channels $K$ given by spectral intensities at various wavelengths, identify marked regions as anomalous. 

The image data are synthetic spectra extracted from annotated prostate histology slices.

In this repo, I try multiple approaches and architectures and compare their performance on this task.
